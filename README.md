This repository is created for AWS_RSD that I do with Terraform.



To create an RDS instance, you would typically need the following:


        1- A VPC with at least two subnets in different availability zones

        2- A security group to control inbound and outbound traffic to the RDS instance

        3- An RDS subnet group to specify which subnets the RDS instance can use

        4- A parameter group to configure the database engine settings

        5- An optional option group to enable additional features

        6- An IAM role with permissions to manage the RDS instance

        7- The desired database engine and version

        8- The desired instance class and storage capacity

        9- The desired database name, username, and password



Keep in mind that the specific requirements may vary depending on your use case and environment.
